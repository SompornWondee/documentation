Event essentials
================

The Odoo *Events* application allows users to create, manage, and analyze events of any kind, with
a complete suite of planning, communication, and reporting tools.

Odoo *Events* is fully-integrated with other Odoo applications, which provides users with the
ability to publish events on their website, sell tickets (online or via sales orders), and grant
access to attendees via barcodes or QR codes. This all-inclusive application also allows users to
send automated messages and social posts leading up to *and* after the event.

With this wide array of useful tools, users can generate and gather valuable data about their
events, and their attendees, which they can use to improve their overall decision-making and
event-planning in the future.

However, before a user can take advantage of all the detailed tools this application provides, they
must first familiarize themselves with the basic dashboards, settings, and features, which is what
this event essentials documentation covers below.

Dashboards
==========

When the *Events* application is opened, Odoo reveals the main :guilabel:`Events` dashboard, which
can be viewed in a number of different ways. Those different view options are accessible from the
:guilabel:`Events` dashboard in the upper-right corner, via a series of view-related icon buttons.

.. image:: event_essentials/view-icons.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The various view icon buttons in the upper-right corner of the dashboard.

The different view options are:

- :ref:`Kanban <event_essentials/dashboards/kanban>` (default)
- :ref:`Calendar <event_essentials/dashboards/calendar>`
- :ref:`List <event_essentials/dashboards/list>`
- :ref:`Gantt <event_essentials/dashboards/gantt>`
- :ref:`Pivot <event_essentials/dashboards/pivot>`
- :ref:`Graph <event_essentials/dashboards/graph>`
- :ref:`Map <event_essentials/dashboards/map>`
- :ref:`Activity <event_essentials/dashboards/activity>`

If at any time the user desires to navigate back to the main dashboard, they can do so by going to
:menuselection:`Events app --> Events`.

By default, the :guilabel:`Events` dashboard shows *all* the events in the database.

.. _event_essentials/dashboards/kanban:

Kanban view
-----------

The Kanban view is the default view of the main :guilabel:`Events` dashboard, and is represented by
the view option displayed as the :guilabel:`two downward-facing columns` icon, located in the
upper-right corner.

This view showcases all the events in the database in their respective stages. By default, the
stages are: :guilabel:`New`, :guilabel:`Booked`, :guilabel:`Announced`, :guilabel:`Ended`, and
:guilabel:`Cancelled`.

.. image:: event_essentials/kanban-dashboard.png

   :alt: The default Kanban dashboard of the Odoo Events application.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Ended` and :guilabel:`Cancelled` stages are folded, by default, and located to the
   right of the other stages.

To add a new stage to the Kanban pipeline, click the :guilabel:`+ Stage` button, located to the
far-right of all the stages. Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`Stage...` text field, in which the name
of the new stage can be entered. When ready, click :guilabel:`Add` to add the new stage to the
Kanban pipeline. Or, click :kbd:`Esc` to discard.

.. image:: event_essentials/stage-field.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Stage text field when adding a new stage to the Odoo Events application.

There are two ways to edit event Kanban stages.

One, users can hover their cursor beside the stage title to reveal a :guilabel:`‚öôÔ∏è (gear)` icon.
When clicked, a drop-down menu appears with various options.

.. image:: event_essentials/gear-dropdown.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The gear drop-down menu at the top of a stage on the Odoo Events main dashboard.

Select :guilabel:`Edit` from this list to reveal an :guilabel:`Edit:(stage name)` pop-up window.

.. image:: event_essentials/edit-stage-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The edit stage pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Events application.

From here, users can modify the configurations of this particular stage however they'd like. Then,
when all the necessary edits are complete, they can click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save and
implement their changes, or :guilabel:`Discard` to discard them.

Every event is represented by an individual Kanban card, which displays its most pertinent
information.

.. image:: event_essentials/event-kanban-card.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical event kanban card in the Odoo Events application.

On each event card, users can find the scheduled date of the event, the name of the event, the
location, the number of expected :guilabel:`Attendees`, any scheduled activities related to the
event, the status of the event, and the person responsible for the event.

To quickly add a new event to a pipeline, click the :guilabel:`‚ûï (plus)` icon at the top of the
stage to which the event should be added to reveal a blank Kanban card to fill out.

.. image:: event_essentials/blank-kanban-card.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical blank kanban card to fill out in the Odoo Events application.

In this blank Kanban card, enter the name of :guilabel:`Event`, along with the :guilabel:`Date`.
Then, either click :guilabel:`Add` to add it to the stage and edit it later, or click
:guilabel:`Edit` to add the event to stage and edit its configurations on a separate page.

Each event card can be dragged-and-dropped into any stage on the Kanban pipeline, providing easy
organizational access.

businesses to participate in the event.

and other similar elements for events.

The :guilabel:`Community Chat Rooms` feature allows users to create virtual conference rooms for
event attendees, providing them with a centralized place to meet and discuss anything related to the
